                        <p className="card-text">Star Wars is an American epic space-opera media franchise created by 
                        George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture 
                        phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including 
                        television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, 
                        comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. The franchise holds a Guinness World Records 
                        title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise". In 2018, the total value of the 
                        Star Wars franchise was estimated at US$65 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing m
                        edia franchise of all time. <br />The original film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope,
                         was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the 
                         Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released, 
                         consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and 
                         Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). Seven years later, Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney, 
                         relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force 
                         Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). 
                         Together, the three trilogies form what has been referred to as the "Skywalker saga". The first 
                         eight films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were 
                         commercially successful. Together with the theatrical spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo: 
                         A Star Wars Story (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 
                         billion, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise.</p>
